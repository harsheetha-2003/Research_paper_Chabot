Study Participants The participants were 132 persons aged 18 and over recruited by the physicians of the Primary Care Center of Villanueva del Pardillo (Madrid). The exclusion criteria were taking vitamin supplements, having diabetes, and planning a change of diet within the next year. Of the 132 persons who agreed to participate, 104 provided complete information at 12 months (losses of 23.5%). Of these, 3 persons reported having changed their diet during the study year, consequently the analyses were made with 101 individuals. The study took place from April 2010 to December 2011. The DH-E Interview The DH-E is a computerized questionnaire administered by a trained interviewer. The interview has two parts. First, the subject is requested to indicate all the foods usually consumed in the previous year. The interview begins with the question: \u2018\u2018What do"

    "answer": "\nThe study concludes that the Spanish Dietary History (DH-E) questionnaire demonstrates acceptable validity and reproducibility for assessing food and nutrient intake in the target population. The findings suggest that DH-E performs comparably to other established dietary assessment instruments, with moderate-to-good reliability for most food groups and nutrients. Specifically, the tool shows stronger reproducibility for energy intake (ICC = 0.66), cereals (ICC = 0.59), meat (ICC = 0.58), and carbohydrates (ICC = 0.58), while exhibiting lower reliability for fish (ICC = 0.38), fruits (ICC = 0.40), and certain nutrients like iron (ICC = 0.14) and vitamin B12 (ICC = 0.15).\n\nThe overall mean intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.45 across all food groups and nutrients indicates moderate reproducibility at the population level, sufficient for epidemiological research purposes. The validation against multiple 24-hour recalls further supports DH-E's capacity to reasonably rank individuals according to their dietary patterns, particularly for energy and macronutrient intake. However, the reduced reliability observed for specific micronutrients and select food groups suggests potential limitations in using DH-E for precise quantification of these dietary components.\n\nThese results position DH-E as a viable tool for large-scale nutritional studies requiring relative intake assessments, with caveats regarding its application to nutrients susceptible to measurement error. The findings underscore the importance of considering variable-specific reliability when interpreting dietary data collected through this instrument."
